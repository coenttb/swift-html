import Foundation

/// Represents the HTML `referrerpolicy` attribute, which controls how much referrer information
/// is included when following links, loading images, or submitting forms.
///
/// The referrer policy affects the Referer HTTP header that is sent to the destination site,
/// specifying the URL of the page that linked to the current request. This attribute helps
/// control privacy and security aspects of navigation.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// // Prevent any referrer information from being sent
/// a(href: "https://example.com", referrerpolicy: .noReferrer) {
///     "Link with no referrer"
/// }
///
/// // Default browser behavior
/// a(href: "https://example.com", referrerpolicy: .strictOriginWhenCrossOrigin) {
///     "Link with default referrer policy"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Security Considerations
///
/// - Using `.noReferrer` or `.sameOrigin` can protect user privacy.
/// - The `.unsafeUrl` policy leaks origins and paths from secure resources to insecure ones.
/// - If no policy is specified, browsers typically use `.strictOriginWhenCrossOrigin`.
///
/// This attribute is supported on various elements including `<a>`, `<area>`, `<img>`, `<iframe>`,
/// `<script>`, and `<link>` elements.
