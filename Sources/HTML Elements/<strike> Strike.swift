/// Represents an HTML `<strike>` element, which places a strikethrough (horizontal line) over text.
///
/// > **Deprecated**: This element is deprecated in HTML 4 and XHTML 1, and obsoleted in the HTML Living Standard.
/// > - If semantically representing deleted content, use `<del>` instead.
/// > - In all other cases, use `<s>` element.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// strike {
///     "Today's Special: Salmon"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Best Practices
///
/// - Avoid using this element in new code as it is deprecated.
/// - Use `<s>` for content that is no longer relevant or accurate.
/// - Use `<del>` for content that has been deleted from a document.
/// - Consider using CSS `text-decoration: line-through` for styling purposes instead.
