import Foundation

/// Represents an HTML noframes element (`<noframes>`), which provides content for browsers 
/// that don't support frames.
///
/// The `FrameFallback` struct provides a way to display alternative content in browsers 
/// that don't support or have disabled support for frames.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// noframes {
///     p {
///         "It seems your browser does not support frames or is configured to not allow them."
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Best Practices
///
/// - This element is deprecated and shouldn't be used in modern web development.
/// - When frames are needed, use the `<iframe>` element instead.
/// - If you must use this element, provide meaningful alternative content that offers 
///   similar functionality to what would be available in the frames.
///

    /// The HTML tag name
    public static var tag: String { "noframes" }
    
    /// The element's content
    public let content: () -> HTML
    
    /// Creates a new FrameFallback element with the specified content.
    ///
    /// - Parameter content: The content to display in browsers that don't support frames
    public init(
        
    ) {
        
    }
}

/// Lowercase typealias for creating FrameFallback elements with a more HTML-like syntax.
