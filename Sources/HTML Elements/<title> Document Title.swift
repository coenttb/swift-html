/// Represents an HTML title element (`<title>`), which defines the document's title
/// that is shown in a browser's title bar or a page's tab.
///
/// The `Title` struct provides a type-safe way to create the HTML title element,
/// which is an essential part of every HTML document and must be contained within
/// the head section. It only contains text; any tags within the element are ignored.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// html {
///   head {
///     title { "Product Catalog - Example Company" }
///     // other metadata
///   }
///   body {
///     // page content
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Best Practices
///
/// - Every HTML document should have a unique, descriptive title
/// - Keep titles under 55-60 characters (search engine display limit)
/// - Put the most important information at the beginning of the title
/// - Avoid single word titles or keyword lists
/// - Include your site name, but typically after the page-specific information
/// - Use a pattern like "Page Name - Site Name" for consistency
///
/// ## SEO and Accessibility
///
/// - Title is a major factor in search engine ranking algorithms
/// - Screen readers announce the title when users navigate to a page
/// - Descriptive titles help users determine if the page contains relevant information
/// - When updating the title dynamically, consider using ARIA Live Regions
///
/// - Note: When rendered, this generates the HTML `<title>` element, which must be
///   placed within the `<head>` element of an HTML document.
public struct Title<HTML>: Element {
    public static var tag: String { "title" }
    
    /// The text content of the title element.
    ///
    /// This should be a descriptive phrase that clearly communicates the purpose of the page.
    /// Only text content is permitted; any HTML tags will be ignored by browsers.
    public var content: () -> HTML
    
    /// Creates a new Title element with the specified text content.
    ///
    /// - Parameter content: The text content of the title element
    public init(
        content: @escaping () -> HTML
    ) {
        self.content = content
    }
}

/// Lowercase typealias for creating Title elements with a more HTML-like syntax.
///
/// This typealias allows you to use the lowercase `title` identifier when creating
/// HTML title elements, which more closely matches HTML syntax.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// title { "Home Page - My Website" }
/// ```
public typealias title = Title
