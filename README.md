# swift-html

A Swift DSL for HTML and CSS that streamlines building HTML documents, built upon [coenttb/pointfree-html](https://www.github.com/coenttb/pointfree-html) and integrated with [swift-css](https://www.github.com/coenttb/swift-css).

![Development Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active--development-blue.svg)

This package is currently in active development and is subject to frequent changes. Features and APIs may change without prior notice until a stable release is available.

## Examples

You can create HTML documents using a declarative, SwiftUI-like syntax, with support for type-safe CSS:

```swift
import HTML

let document = HTMLPreview.modern {
  h1 { "Type-safe HTML" }
    .color(.blue)
    .fontSize(24.px)
  p { "With type-safe CSS!" }
    .margin(top: 10.px, bottom: 10.px)
}
```

For a quick start, use HTMLPreview.modern to give your document a modern look. Alternatively, create a custom implementation by conforming your HTMLDocument struct or enum to the HTMLDocument protocol.

### SwiftUI Preview Example

You can preview your HTML directly using SwiftUI:
```
#if canImport(SwiftUI)
import SwiftUI
import HTML

#Preview {
  HTMLPreview.modern {
    h1 { "Welcome!" }
      .color(.blue)
      .fontSize(24.px)
    p { "You've found our site!" }
      .margin(top: 10.px, bottom: 10.px)
  }
}
#endif
```

## HTML & CSS domain specific language in Swift

This DSL leverages Swift’s type system to make constructing HTML documents and elements safer and more reliable. The APIs enforce proper types, minimizing the use of raw strings and reducing common errors.

The integration with [swift-css](https://www.github.com/coenttb/swift-css) ensures a type-safe system that allows that only valid CSS properties to be applied to HTML elements, helping catch styling mistakes at compile time.

## FAQ

**Can I use this with existing Swift web frameworks like Vapor?** 

Yes, you can! See [coenttb-com-server](https://www.github.com/coenttb/coenttb-com-server) for an example implementation.
